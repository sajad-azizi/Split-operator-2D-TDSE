# Split operator 2D TDSE

Solving time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation using split operator method. In this project, we first use imaginary time propagation to get ground state eigenvalue and wavefunction. Then we solve TDSE for a laser pulse (linear or circular).
We used FFTW package for fast Fourier transform
